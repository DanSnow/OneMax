OneMax
======

## Description ##
This is a project implement genetic algorithm to solve one max problem.
I write it just for fun and I only learn a little about this problem on class.
So I'm not sure if my algorithm is implement rightly.

There are implement in two language, ruby and go.
In ruby version. It just implement once time gene cross.
